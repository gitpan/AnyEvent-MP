Revision history for AnyEvent::MP

TODO: testsuite
TODO: intro: maybe simple job pool example?
TODO: intro: mention watchdog...

1.1  Fri Sep 11 04:34:03 CEST 2009
	- bumped the transport protocol to version 1 - sorry, but there
          were too many bugfixes/changes.
	- new function AnyEvent::MP::cal for simple rpc.
	- renamed AnyEvent::MP::Global functions to grp_reg|get|mon.
        - implemented monitoring for Global groups.
	- removed all userspace time-outs from the transport, instead
          rely on tcp retransmit timeouts and tcp keepalive.
	- spawn now delays spawns on the local node artificially, so
          it can return before invoking the init function.
        - break endless recursion between ping-pong ports on the local
          node after ~50 iterations.
        - support JSON-encoded aemp arguments.
        - added aemp restart.
        - support for starting init functions with parameters added.
        - data_format, auth_offer and auth_accept are now configurable, albeit
          not documented.
        - new service: AnyEvent::MP::LogCatcher.
        - rely on perl srand'ing better than we could.
        - try to backport to 5.8.2, unfortunately, recursive dependencies
          rely on Module::Build, which fails at 5.8.7, so YMMV.
        - use a vastly different reseeding strategy.
        - use seed nodes to notify nodes about new nodes.
        - in the case where a ndoe learns new addresses after it tried
          connecting, prefer the new addrseses over the old ones.

1.0  Wed Sep  2 20:40:43 CEST 2009
	- randomise more connection times, but reduce delay to 0.2s (seeds)
          and 0.05s (normal connects).
        - upgrade to and require AnyEvent::Watchdog 1.0.

0.95 Mon Aug 31 22:03:55 CEST 2009
	- tutorial finally covers all the basics, maybe not optimally, but it
          is covered.
	- rename initialise_node to configure and accepts key => value
          pairs for configuration.
	- give aemp a full manpage.
	- bin/aemp now expects comma-separated lists and supports multiple
          subcommands.
        - new aemp eval subcommand.
        - new aemp parent subcommand.
        - nodes get freed when no longer needed.
        - support "*" hostname to specify all local interface addresses
          (without localhost etc.).
        - support "*" port to specify a dynamically-assigned port (which
          is the default now).
        - fix per-transport memory leak.

0.9  Sat Aug 29 18:47:45 CEST 2009
	- tutorial was updated to reflect the current API, but
          does not touch monitoring yet.
	- got rid of noderefs and slave nodes entirely, introduce
          free-text node identifiers and anonymous nodes.
        - document security issues with tls_anon method and introduce
          optional tls_md6_64_256 method.

0.8  Wed Aug 19 07:54:50 CEST 2009
	- added AnyEvent::MP::Global service.
	- support "package::" names as service names.
        - many, many, many bugfixes and tweaks.

0.7  Sat Aug 15 01:18:51 CEST 2009
	- sorry, another major API simplification.
	- greatly improved aemp configuration abilities.
        - introduced profile management.
        - updated exmaples in eg/.
        - added Kernel::snd_to_func.

0.6  Thu Aug 13 03:15:05 CEST 2009
	- do away with .aemp-secret and use .perl-anyevent-mp as json config
          file.
        - introduce bin/aemp to configure nodes.
        - too many changes to describe.

0.4  Sun Aug  9 18:05:49 CEST 2009
	- API should now be really stable :)
	- distinguish between resolved and unresolved noderefs.
	- certificates in .aemp-secret are now supported.
        - change port creation semantics.
        - replace become_xxx by initialise_node.
        - implement AE::MP::spawn.
        - implement transport timeouts, monitoring, reconnecting.
        - simplify and partially document the transport protocol.

0.1  Tue Aug  4 23:07:11 CEST 2009
	- AnyEvent::MP API should be mostly stable by now.

0.02 Sun Aug  2 17:46:43 CEST 2009
	- design has stabilised a bit, sitll unusable.

0.01 Sat Aug  1 11:43:31 CEST 2009
	- dummy upload to reserve namespace on CPAN.

0.0  Thu Jul 30 06:10:15 CEST 2009
	- original version, an AnyEvent::AIO clone.
