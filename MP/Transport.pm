AnyEvent::MP::Transport - actual transport protocol handler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use AnyEvent::MP::Transport;

This module implements (and documents) the actual transport protocol for
AEMP.

See the "PROTOCOL" section below if you want to write another client for
this protocol.

Creates a listener on the given host/port using
C<AnyEvent::Socket::tcp_server>.

See C<new>, below, for constructor arguments.

=head1 PROTOCOL

The AEMP protocol is comparatively simple, and consists of three phases
which are symmetrical for both sides: greeting (followed by optionally
switching to TLS mode), authentication and packet exchange.

The protocol is designed to allow both full-text and binary streams.

The greeting consists of two text lines that are ended by either an ASCII
CR LF pair, or a single ASCII LF (recommended).

=head2 GREETING

All the lines until after authentication must not exceed 4kb in length,
including line delimiter. Afterwards there is no limit on the packet size
that can be received.

=head3 First Greeting Line

Example:

   aemp;0;rain;tls_md6_64_256,hmac_md6_64_256,tls_anon,cleartext;json,storable;timeout=12;peeraddr=10.0.0.1:48082

The first line contains strings separated (not ended) by C<;>
characters. The first five strings are fixed by the protocol, the
remaining strings are C<KEY=VALUE> pairs. None of them may contain C<;>
characters themselves (when escaping is needed, use C<%3b> to represent
C<;> and C<%25> to represent C<%>)-

The fixed strings are:

=over 4

=item protocol identification

The constant C<aemp> to identify this protocol.

=item protocol version

The protocol version supported by this end, currently C<1>. If the
versions don't match then no communication is possible. Minor extensions
are supposed to be handled through additional key-value pairs.

=item the node ID

This is the node ID of the connecting node.

=item the acceptable authentication methods

A comma-separated list of authentication methods supported by the
node. Note that AnyEvent::MP supports a C<hex_secret> authentication
method that accepts a clear-text password (hex-encoded), but will not use
this authentication method itself.

The receiving side should choose the first authentication method it
supports.

=item the acceptable framing formats

A comma-separated list of packet encoding/framing formats understood. The
receiving side should choose the first framing format it supports for
sending packets (which might be different from the format it has to accept).

=back

The remaining arguments are C<KEY=VALUE> pairs. The following key-value
pairs are known at this time:

=over 4

=item provider=<module-version>

The software provider for this implementation. For AnyEvent::MP, this is
C<AE-0.0> or whatever version it currently is at.

=item peeraddr=<host>:<port>

The peer address (socket address of the other side) as seen locally.

=item tls=<major>.<minor>

Indicates that the other side supports TLS (version should be 1.0) and
wishes to do a TLS handshake.

=back

=head3 Second Greeting Line

After this greeting line there will be a second line containing a
cryptographic nonce, i.e. random data of high quality. To keep the
protocol text-only, these are usually 32 base64-encoded octets, but
it could be anything that doesn't contain any ASCII CR or ASCII LF
characters.

I<< The two nonces B<must> be different, and an aemp implementation
B<must> check and fail when they are identical >>.

Example of a nonce line (yes, it's random-looking because it is random
data):

   2XYhdG7/O6epFa4wuP0ujAEx1rXYWRcOypjUYK7eF6yWAQr7gwIN9m/2+mVvBrTPXz5GJDgfGm9d8QRABAbmAP/s

=head2 TLS handshake

I<< If, after the handshake, both sides indicate interest in TLS, then the
connection B<must> use TLS, or fail to continue. >>

Both sides compare their nonces, and the side who sent the lower nonce
value ("string" comparison on the raw octet values) becomes the client,
and the one with the higher nonce the server.

=head2 AUTHENTICATION PHASE

After the greeting is received (and the optional TLS handshake),
the authentication phase begins, which consists of sending a single
C<;>-separated line with three fixed strings and any number of
C<KEY=VALUE> pairs.

The three fixed strings are:

=over 4

=item the authentication method chosen

This must be one of the methods offered by the other side in the greeting.

Note that all methods starting with C<tls_> are only valid I<iff> TLS was
successfully handshaked (and to be secure the implementation must enforce
this).

The currently supported authentication methods are:

=over 4

=item cleartext

This is simply the shared secret, lowercase-hex-encoded. This method is of
course very insecure if TLS is not used (and not completely secure even
if TLS is used), which is why this module will accept, but not generate,
cleartext auth replies.

=item hmac_md6_64_256

This method uses an MD6 HMAC with 64 bit blocksize and 256 bit hash, and
requires a shared secret. It is the preferred auth method when a shared
secret is available.

First, the shared secret is hashed with MD6:

   key = MD6 (secret)

This secret is then used to generate the "local auth reply", by taking
the two local greeting lines and the two remote greeting lines (without
line endings), appending \012 to all of them, concatenating them and
calculating the MD6 HMAC with the key:

   lauth = HMAC_MD6 key, "lgreeting1\012lgreeting2\012rgreeting1\012rgreeting2\012"

This authentication token is then lowercase-hex-encoded and sent to the
other side.

Then the remote auth reply is generated using the same method, but local
and remote greeting lines swapped:

   rauth = HMAC_MD6 key, "rgreeting1\012rgreeting2\012lgreeting1\012lgreeting2\012"

This is the token that is expected from the other side.

=item tls_anon

This type is only valid I<iff> TLS was enabled and the TLS handshake
was successful. It has no authentication data, as the server/client
certificate was successfully verified.

This authentication type is somewhat insecure, as it allows a
man-in-the-middle attacker to change some of the connection parameters
(such as the framing format), although there is no known attack that
exploits this in a way that is worse than just denying the service.

By default, this implementation accepts but never generates this auth
reply.

=item tls_md6_64_256

This type is only valid I<iff> TLS was enabled and the TLS handshake was
successful.

This authentication type simply calculates:

   lauth = MD6 "rgreeting1\012rgreeting2\012lgreeting1\012lgreeting2\012"

and lowercase-hex encodes the result and sends it as authentication
data. No shared secret is required (authentication is done by TLS). The
checksum exists only to make tinkering with the greeting hard.

=back

=item the authentication data

The authentication data itself, usually base64 or hex-encoded data, see
above.

=item the framing protocol chosen

This must be one of the framing protocols offered by the other side in the
greeting. Each side must accept the choice of the other side, and generate
packets in the format it chose itself.

=back

Example of an authentication reply:

   hmac_md6_64_256;363d5175df38bd9eaddd3f6ca18aa1c0c4aa22f0da245ac638d048398c26b8d3;json

=head2 DATA PHASE

After this, packets get exchanged using the chosen framing protocol. It is
quite possible that both sides use a different framing protocol.

=head2 FULL EXAMPLE

This is an actual protocol dump of a handshake, followed by a single data
packet. The greater than/less than lines indicate the direction of the
transfer only.

=head2 MONITORING

Monitoring the connection itself is transport-specific. For TCP, all
connection monitoring is currently left to TCP retransmit time-outs
on a busy link, and TCP keepalive (which should be enabled) for idle
connections.

This is not sufficient for listener-less nodes, however: they need
to regularly send data (30 seconds, or the monitoring interval, is
recommended), so TCP actively probes.

Future implementations of AnyEvent::Transport might query the kernel TCP
buffer after a write timeout occurs, and if it is non-empty, shut down the
connections, but this is an area of future research :)

=head2 NODE PROTOCOL

The transport simply transfers messages, but to implement a full node, a
special node port must exist that understands a number of requests.

If you are interested in implementing this, drop us a note so we finish
the documentation.
